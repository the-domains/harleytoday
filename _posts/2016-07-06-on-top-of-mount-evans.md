The 14 mile ride to the top of Mount Evans is one that we will always remember as having beautiful scenery and also being one of the scariest rides we've done. At times while riding up the mountain it would appear as if the road just ended at the top. Narrow roads and turns along with sheer drop offs, and damaged roads in some areas makes this a ride to remember.
